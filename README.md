# CambridgeTHzConverter
Cambridge Terahertz Converter for the dotTHz project

Cambridge Terahertz Converter and other tools available at dotTHzTAG repositories were coded using MATLAB(R2022a) App-Designer.
Therefore, it is necessary to install MATLAB and MATLAB App-Designer before you use all the tools.

Basically, the MATLAB App-Designer file is a binary file and a text editor cannot open the file neither track its revisions. Instead, 'CambridgeTHzconveter_exported.m' file is uploaded as a pair using 'save - export to m file' function in MATLAB App-Designer. This file is only for revision referencing, and it cannot be imported in MATLAB App-Desinger.

To use the CambridgeTHzConverter, pleaese follow the instructions below.

1. Download 'CambridgeTHzconverter.mlapp' and all image files (.png) from the repository.
2. Move the files to where you want to install.
3. Make 'engine' sub-folder at the folder where CambridgeTHzconveter.mlapp and image files are located.
4. the engine subfolder is where the converter '.m' scripts are located.
5. Download a proper engine .m file from 'Conveter engines' repository.
6. Move the downloaded the engine .m file to the 'engine' subfolder.
7. Double-click 'CambridgeTHzConveter.mlapp' file to launch the tool.
