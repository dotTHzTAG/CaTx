# CaTx (CambridgeTHzConverter)
CaTx for the dotTHz project

Please note that Cambridge THz Converter (CaTx) and other tools available at the dotTHzTAG repositories are based on MATLAB(R2022a) App-Designer environment. Therefore, it is necessary to install MATLAB and MATLAB App-Designer before using all the tools.

The MATLAB App-Designer file is a binary file, and a text editor cannot open the file or track its revisions. Instead, the 'CambridgeTHzconveter_exported.m' file is uploaded as a pair using 'save - export to m file' function in MATLAB App-Designer. This file is only for revision referencing for human and cannot be imported in MATLAB App-Desinger.

To use the CambridgeTHzConverter, pleaese follow the instructions below:

1. Download all files, including folders, from the repository.
2. Move the files and folders to your desired installation location.
3. You are now ready to proceed. Double-click 'CambridgeTHzconveter.mlapp' or open it with MATLAB Appdesigner.
4. Once the tool is launched, select an appropriate converter engine using the 'THz CONVERTER ENGINE' dropdown menu.

Please note that the list of converter engiens is based on the MATLAB m script files in the engine subfolder. You may need to create your own engine for your instrument or applications.
