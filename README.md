**Installation guide**

Please download the installation package file, entitled 'Install_releaseDate.zip,' and unzip at your local hard drive. CaTx.mlapp is a MATLAB App-Designer (version r2022a) file and runs on MATLAB environment. If MATLAB is not installed in your PC, please visit https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html and install the latest version before you run CaTx. 

The MATLAB App-Designer file (*.mlapp) is a binary file, and a text editor cannot open the file or track its revisions. For the sake of identifying the changes between revisions, 'CambridgeTHzconveter_exported.m' file is also uploaded as a pair. This file is generated using [save] - [export to m file] menu in MATLAB App-Designer.  In case you modify mlapp files and commit back to the repository, please update and upload the associated .m file as well so that users can easily track the changes in the code.

**Please follow the instructions below.**
1. MATLAB needs to be installed in your computer to use CaTx.
2. Download 'Install_releaseDate.zip' file. <a href="/" download="Install_r230918.zip">Download</a>
3. Unzip the package file into the folder where you'd like to keep them.
4. You are now ready to proceed. Double-click 'CambridgeTHzconveter.mlapp' or open it with MATLAB Appdesigner.
5. Once the tool is launched, select an appropriate converter engine using the 'THz CONVERTER ENGINE' dropdown menu.

Please note that the converter engines are listed based on the MATLAB *.m script files in the engine subfolder. While a set of engines are provided, you may need to modify them or create your own engine for your own project.
